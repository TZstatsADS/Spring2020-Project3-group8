### Code lib Folder

This folder constains mainly three type of files:

+ change_images, inv_change_images: the two functions we used in pre-processing of the data

+ feature_baseline, feature: the two functions we used to extract features, where feature_baseline is the function contains all pairwise distance of 78 points and feature function is the function contains all improved features and color features

+ the remaining all files are the training functions and predicting functions we will need to use when we train data and do prediction
